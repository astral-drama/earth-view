# Story: eavir-6 - Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Integration

## Overview
Implement advanced time synchronization analysis for high-precision networks using PTP (IEEE 1588) and enhanced NTP monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PTP grandmaster clock identification and visualization
- [ ] Sub-microsecond time accuracy measurements
- [ ] Network path delay analysis and visualization
- [ ] Clock hierarchy tree visualization (PTP boundary/transparent clocks)
- [ ] Real-time time drift monitoring with alerts
- [ ] Frequency compensation analysis
- [ ] Time source quality indicators (GPS, atomic clock, etc.)

## Technical Details
- PTP protocol analysis and packet inspection
- High-resolution time measurement APIs
- Network path analysis for asymmetric delays
- Clock stability calculations and trending
- Integration with hardware timestamping
- Real-time alert system for time anomalies

## Data Sources
- PTP announce messages
- Hardware timestamp counters
- Network switch PTP capabilities
- GPS time reference signals
- Atomic clock references

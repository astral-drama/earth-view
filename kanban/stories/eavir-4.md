# Story: eavir-4 - Enhanced Atmospheric Effects

## Overview
Implement realistic atmospheric scattering, aurora effects, and improved cloud rendering for a more photorealistic Earth view.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rayleigh scattering for blue sky effect
- [ ] Mie scattering for atmospheric haze
- [ ] Aurora borealis/australis effects at poles
- [ ] Volumetric cloud rendering with proper shadows
- [ ] Atmospheric perspective for distant features
- [ ] Dynamic weather systems visualization

## Technical Details
- Advanced fragment shaders for scattering
- Particle systems for aurora effects
- 3D cloud volume rendering
- Real weather data integration APIs

## Dependencies
- Requires eavir-2 (textures) and eavir-3 (lighting)

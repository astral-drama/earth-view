# Story: eavir-5 - Time Server Network Overlay

## Overview
Add real-time time server visualization showing NTP/PTP server locations, network latency patterns, and time synchronization accuracy across the globe.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Time server location markers (NTP, PTP, GPS-disciplined)
- [ ] Real-time ping/latency visualization with color coding
- [ ] Time drift analysis and accuracy indicators
- [ ] Network topology connections between servers
- [ ] Server information panels (stratum, accuracy, location)
- [ ] Time zone correlation with server positions
- [ ] Historical time drift trend overlays

## Technical Details
- NTP server discovery and polling
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Latency visualization with animated pulses
- Time drift calculation and trending
- Geographic coordinate mapping for servers
- Interactive server selection and detailed metrics

## Data Sources
- NTP pool project server lists
- Public NTP server databases
- Real-time ping measurements
- Time synchronization accuracy data
- Geographic IP location services

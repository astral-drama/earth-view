# Story: eavir-1 - Setup Basic Earth Rendering

## Overview
Implement the foundation WebGL Earth renderer with basic sphere geometry, procedural textures, and interactive camera controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] WebGL context initialization with proper error handling
- [x] Sphere geometry generation with UV texture coordinates
- [x] Basic vertex and fragment shaders for Earth rendering
- [x] Procedural texture generation for Earth day/night/clouds
- [x] Mouse controls for rotation and zoom
- [x] Basic UI controls for adjusting view parameters
- [x] 60 FPS rendering performance target
- [x] Cross-browser WebGL compatibility

## Technical Details

### WebGL Setup
- Initialize WebGL context with fallback to experimental-webgl
- Enable depth testing and face culling
- Set up viewport and clear color
- Error handling for unsupported browsers

### Geometry
- Sphere tessellation with configurable detail (32x32 default)
- Generate vertices, normals, and UV coordinates
- Use indexed triangles for efficiency
- Store in WebGL vertex buffer objects

### Shaders
- Vertex shader: MVP transformations, lighting calculations
- Fragment shader: Day/night texture blending, atmospheric effects
- Uniform variables for matrices, time, and feature toggles
- Attribute variables for vertex data

### Textures
- Procedural day texture (blue oceans, green/brown land)
- Procedural night texture (dark with yellow city lights)
- Procedural cloud texture (white clouds with alpha channel)
- WebGL texture setup with appropriate filtering

### Controls
- Mouse drag for rotation (X/Y axis rotation)
- Mouse wheel for zoom (constrained between 1.5-10)
- UI sliders for rotation speed and zoom level
- Checkboxes for atmosphere, clouds, night lights

## Implementation Notes
- Use gl-matrix library for matrix operations
- Implement in vanilla JavaScript for simplicity
- Modular architecture with EarthRenderer class
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance monitoring with FPS counter

## Key Implementation Guidance

**Projection Matrix**: Initialize projection matrix immediately in the renderer init() method, not just on resize. Without proper initialization, nothing will render even if all other components are correct.

**Triangle Winding Order**: Generate sphere indices with counter-clockwise winding for outward-facing triangles. The pattern should be: first vertex, first+1, second vertex, then second, first+1, second+1. Incorrect winding makes the Earth appear inside-out.

**UV Texture Coordinates**: Flip the U coordinate horizontally by using (1.0 - longitude/lonBands) to prevent mirrored geography. Standard UV mapping will show continents reversed.

**WebGL State**: Enable depth testing and backface culling early in setup. Set the cull face to BACK to hide interior triangles.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Earth renders correctly in all major browsers
- [x] Interactive controls work smoothly
- [x] Code is well-documented and modular
- [x] No console errors or warnings
- [x] Passes basic performance tests (60 FPS on modern hardware)
- [x] Ready for enhancement with real texture maps

## Issues Resolved
- **Fixed projection matrix initialization**: Added proper projection matrix setup in renderer init()
- **Fixed aspect ratio handling**: Set correct aspect ratio before renderer initialization
- **Verified rendering pipeline**: All shaders, textures, and geometry working correctly
